# python-pint-in-javascript
Wrapping [Pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint) in Javascript with [Pypy.js](https://github.com/pypyjs/pypyjs).

Because it's there and pint is a good unit conversion library. But it's slow.

Don't use this.

## How to Run

- Have `python`, `pip`, and `node` installed.
- Run `npm install` to install node and pip packages to the directory.
- Run `npm start` to start a static server
- Visit `localhost:9080` and open the javascript console.
